My name is **Yuknavell** (He/His/Him/His). I come in many names but **Yukna** or **Yadobler** is fine. I come from sunny [Singapore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singapore).

## Quick fluffy introduction
Tech-savvy and culturally curious, I strive to unearth the sciences in the arts and the arts in the sciences. I explore, introspect, experiment, and learn from collaborating with people from all walks of life, dabbling in tech, customer service, human resource, outdoor lifestyle and leadership experiences.

## What I study
I am a Computer Science major at National University of Singapore. I also minor in Linguistics (English). My current focus is in [Information Retrieval](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_retrieval) and [Computer Security](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_security).

## What I like
I love languages. I currently speak English, Tamil, Malay, Mandarin, a bit of Cantonese, and a touch of Vietnamese (I also speak C, Java, Python, ASMx86, Lua, Nix, and some Javascript).
I like the sciences, especially physics, cellular biology, and chemistry. I like literary analysis of songs and poems, although I am not fond of reading books. 
I __like__ maths - at least the fun rigour of proofs and linear algebra. Anything not very calculus-heavy. I like to watch big machinaries, trains, trucks and buses. I like Curry Maggie Noddles - if done right. 
I like Minecraft, especially modded minecraft with TerraFirmaCraft.


## Sports?
I am not very active but I like rollerblading (inline skating). I used to paddle in a Dragonboat team, which feels great since it was the only time my skin was not rashing in the sweat and heat and my nose was not blocked. Controvertially I hate soccer (football).

## What's my name?
### Here are some valid names:
- **Yuknavell**: This is my first name. I write this on my homeworks any non-official documents.
- **Yuknavell S&#47;O Thiyagarajan**: My legal name. A patronym, where S&#47;O refers to ['son of'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Singaporeans#Naming_conventions). Shortens (officially) to **T. Yuknavell**.
- **Yukna**: This is my canonical shortened name and probably what I introduce myself as in real life.
- **Vell**: I sign off as __Yukna Vell__, to emphasise __Yukna__ as the canonical term of addess. This also implies my last name is __Vell__, leading some to address me as **(Mr.) Vell**. I do not mind despite the technicallities.
- **Yadobler**: This is my main username. Treat me a meal and I'll explain the history of this.
- **யுக்னவேல்**: **Yuknavell** in Tamil. It is [Vighna விக்ன ](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E0%A4%B5%E0%A4%BF%E0%A4%98%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%A8#Sanskrit) + [Vel வேல்](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vel). Vighna (Obstacles) is from __Vighneshwara__ or [__**Vignaa** Vinayagar__](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ganesha) so my name would be both brother Gods Ganeshan and Muragan. Anyways something happened and I became __Yukna__vell. As far as i know, there's no meaningful Dravidian or Indo-European lemma with __Yukna__.
- **<Furigana hanzi="威玉鉤" jyutping="wai1 juk6 ngau1" />**: **Wai Yuhk Ngau** in Cantonese Yale (Jyutping in ruby/furigana above each character). This becomes **Wēi Yù Gōu** in mandarin, and **Oai Ngọc Câu** in Vietnamese. Yes, __Yu Gou__, __Yuhk Ngau__, __'Au__, and  __"Câu"__ are not normal names. However, what __makes__ a name???? Surprisingly __Yuhk Ngau__ sounds like my name without [Initial nasal dropping __(ngau -> au)__](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proper_Cantonese_pronunciation)


Also what is up with the unicode encoding:  <Image src={Mangled} alt='Mangled rendering of Tamil unicode in neovim' />

### Here are **NOT** names:
- **Abdullah**: Amusing but it's not my name.
- **(Mr.) Thiyagarajan**: That is my father, not me.
- **Yuknav**: incorrect.
- **Yu-na**: Many people (of Hokkien descent) find it hard to pronounce the __k__ sound. I'll forgive this but if possible, do not call me [Yoo na](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Im_Yoon-ah)
- **Ah Yuk**: Had a boss who called me that. He lost his job and got dishonorably discharged from service - Such is the __character__ of anyone who calls me ah yuk. You must rethink your life if you are that person.
- **Yuki**: reserved.
- **Vela**: reserved.
