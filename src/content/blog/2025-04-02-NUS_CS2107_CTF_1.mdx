# What is this?

Recently I completed and received the results of my 1st CTF of National University of Singapore (NUS) CS2107 Information Security course. This assignment particularly focuses on the security aspects of crypto and ciphers, particularly how every *bolt* of this mechanism plays a part and cutting one might completely render the whole entire security obsolete.

Honestly, it was very fun! I think this has taught me more on how we cannot blindly trust encryption just because it is industry standards - we need to use them properly. It reminds me of those tiktok/vine videos of people bolting their door shut with a slide bolt, only for the door to slide open instead of being unable to swing open.

I actually was addicted to this and neglected to complete my other assignments... :sad:

# Preface

All assignments were done using an ephemeral nix-shell with the following config (Note - this is **not recommended** when doing CTFs because accidentally running any programme or script is *a great way to have a bad day*):

```nix 
{ pkgs ? import <nixpkgs> {} }:
pkgs.mkShell {
  buildInputs = with pkgs; [
    gcc
    hexdump
    file
    (python3.withPackages (ps: with ps; with python3Packages; [
      bpython
      pwntools
      pycryptodome
      python-dotenv
      # randcrack
      (
        buildPythonPackage rec {
          pname = "randcrack";
          version = "0.2.0";
          src = fetchPypi {
            inherit pname version;
            sha256 = "sha256-zM9OzeoUdmZTDwgm0Rpyv8lnzNerNuLt+alR3nwHAhs=";
          };
          doCheck = false;
        }
      )
    ]))
  ];
}
```

The python version is as followed: `Python 3.12.8`


The gcc version is as followed: 

```text
╰─❯ gcc -v
Using built-in specs.
Target: x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu
Thread model: posix
Supported LTO compression algorithms: zlib

Author: Jonathan Loh

Happy birthday! Here's a message written using our favorite emoji lang! As 
    usual, each emoji maps 
    to a letter!

```

This is a 1-to-1 substitution cipher. I was initially inclined to analyse the frequency of the emoji cipher and map them to the known frequency distribution of English, but if the message is written with _liberty_ then it might not provide the correct frequency.

However, I noticed two things:

1. There were two-letter and three-letter words which could only belong to a finite number of English words
2. The message is definitely _Birthday_ themed.

Therefore I first saw a string that matched the character distribution of *Happy Birthday* I put them in a `Dict[str,str]` in python where the key (emoji) maps to the value of the corresponding message. There were duplicate keys, which corresponds to the duplicate _p_, _a_, _h_ and _y_ in _happy birthday_.

![Birthday](@assets/cs2107-assignment-01/E.1/20250213-111517-original.png)


I then loop through each character and if there exist a key-pair value, I append the associated charater into a new result string. Else append the cipher character itself.

```py
message = ""
for c in cipher:
    if c in dictionary:
        message += dictionary[c]
    else:
        message += c
print(message)
```

At the first iteration, there is still a lot needed to be deciphered.

![First Iteration](@assets/cs2107-assignment-01/E.1/20250213-111620-original.png)

It however gave much clues, and I continued to decipher the emojis that replaced obvious characters in certain words. For example:

![Another Year On](@assets/cs2107-assignment-01/E.1/20250213-111733-original.png)

This continued for serveral iterations. However, other than looking at the undeciphered characters, I was also looking at whether the deciphered ones were correct. I realised some mistakes I did. I did not recognise any words ending with _UAA_ or _AAA_:

![Mistakes](@assets/cs2107-assignment-01/E.1/20250213-111923-original.png)

I realised that the _AAA_ mapped to `😀🤬🤬`, meaning I accidentally mapped two emojis to the same character _A_. I guessed this was supposed to be _ALL_, so I went to check and sure enough it was keyed in wrongly. 

![Wrong A](@assets/cs2107-assignment-01/E.1/20250213-112106-original.png)

I changed it to _L_ and try again. I noticed another issue, where the _G_ became _T_ leading to _THINT_. 

![Wrong T](@assets/cs2107-assignment-01/E.1/20250213-112601-original.png)

I fix that and was left with 5 more characters:

![2107 Emoji](@assets/cs2107-assignment-01/E.1/20250213-112655-original.png)

The last charater is _J_ in _EMOJI_, which interestingly did not appear anywhere else. The first four, had to be _2107_ since it would yield the format of the key as described in the instructions.

![instructions](@assets/cs2107-assignment-01/E.1/20250213-112935-original.png)

The deciphered message:

```text
HAPPY BIRTHDAY!! HOPE YOUR DAY’S FULL OF GOOD VIBES, GOOD FOOD, AND ALL THE 
    THINGS YOU LOVE. YOU DESERVE THE BEST, SO MAKE SURE TO TREAT YOURSELF (AND 
    EAT EXTRA CAKE FOR ME LOL). ALSO, HERE’S TO CELEBRATING THE SECRET LANGUAGE
    WE USE TO TALK TO EACH OTHER EVERY DAY. IT MAKES EVERYTHING SO MUCH MORE

## E.2 Cracking hashes!

prompt:

```text
Author: Lee Kai Xuan

Yo, try cracking this hash: e82d0df0e1001e2c33bc12900faf06e5

But watch out for those rocks! They may just rock you! Wrap the string in 
    "CS2107{FLAG}". For example, if e82d0df0e1001e2c33bc12900faf06e5 is the 
    hash of the word "ilovecs", the flag is CS2107{ilovecs}

Unlock Hint for 0 points
Try some hash cracking tools! There's something about "hash of a cat", or even 
    a guy named "John" hmm...

Unlock Hint for 0 points
Once you have the tool, you just need a wordlist! There's something about this 
    hash that will "rock you" hmm...

```

My gosh. Looking at the hints, it is definitely using JohnTheReaper to crack, using the infamous `rockyou.txt` list.

That being said, I am lazy so I just opened up [CyberChef](https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/) and pasted the link into the Input. I use the **Anaylse Hash** recipe and get the output:

```
Hash length: 32
Byte length: 16
Bit length:  128

Based on the length, this hash could have been generated by one of the 
    following hashing functions:
MD5
MD4
MD2
HAVAL-128
RIPEMD-128
Snefru
Tiger-128
```

I will hazard a guess and say it is *MD2* / *MD4* / *MD5*. Since the clue is **Rockyou.txt**, most online free-to-use reverse MD5 dehashers will be able to use the rainbow table to reverse lookup. I choose [md5decrypt.net](https://md5decrypt.net/en/). Here is the output:

![dehash](@assets/cs2107-assignment-01/E.2/20250214-212846-original.png)

Key: `CS2107{cs2107711923}`

## E.3 Sub Sub Sub 

Prompt: 

```text
Author: River Koh

Is this what they call layered security? Here's a bunch of substition ciphers, 
    even if you know the key, it would take you really long to trace and 
    decrypt the flag!

DQ2107{KUO_OISQ_OAAH_EAM_P_VISNU}
```

I can tell from the _2107_ in the last line that it is the encrypted flag. Immediately, I can tell that `C` mapped to `D` and `S`mapped to `Q`. If we compared the first and last line of the substition cipher given, we get:

```text
A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z
P K D F U B L I S Z H N X T A Y G J Q O M C V R E W
DQ2107{KUO_OISQ_OAAH_EAM_P_VISNU}
```

Sure enough, `C` mapped to `D` and `S`mapped to `Q`. No matter how many layers of substitution, the composition of every substition function map yields a single substition map.

I open up [CyberChef](https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/) and used the **substite** recipe, giving the plaintext and ciphertext strings:

![E3 Incorrect](@assets/cs2107-assignment-01/E.3/20250214-214044-original.png)

Oops. The output is `FG2107{HMA_ASQG_APPI_UPX_Y_CSQTM}` which is clearly wrong. I forgot to reverse the plaintext and ciphertext key!

![E3 Correct](@assets/cs2107-assignment-01/E.3/20250214-214223-original.png)

## M.1 Crackable AES?

Prompt:

Author: Cao Yitian

I was told this is crackable! But it is encrypted in AES... isn't that uncrackable?

Oh, and I was also told to "watch out for the red herring", whatever that means...

Unlock Hint for 0 points
Is there another way to attack this encryption?

```

Attachments:
- `output`
- `herring.py`

`herring.py` contains:
```py 
# Flag is the secret and will be in the format CS2107{50m3th1ng}

# 3 things to import
from Crypto.Cipher import AES
from random import randbytes
from Crypto.Util.Padding import pad

# Randomly generated key!
cipher = AES.new(randbytes(16),AES.MODE_ECB)
secret = "[REDACTED]"
code = open("herring.py","rb").read()

with open("output","wb") as f:
    for i in code:
        f.write(cipher.encrypt(pad(bytes([i]),16)))

```

while `output` is a data file according to `file`.

Things I noted:
1. AES using _electronic codebook mode encryption (ECB)_
2. Block size of 16 bytes and **each character is padded to 16 bytes**
3. `output` is the encryption of `herring.py` but _probably_ without the `secret` decrypted.

ECB is vulnerable because cipher blocks are identical if plaintext is.

I first do a sanity check to confirm that each character is taken as 8-bit byte and then padded to 16 bytes (128 bits):

```text
╰─❯ wc -c output
7312 output
╰─❯ wc -c empty.py 
407 empty.py
```

The encrypted file size of 4352 is **16 times larger** than the original file. This correctly indicates that each 1-byte character of the source python file is encrypted into 16 bytes of encrypted blocks. This helps us guess the length of the secret key.

```text
╰─❯ wc -c output
7312 output
╰─❯ wc -c empty.py 
407 empty.py
```

The original encrypted file is 7312 bytes, which means the original file is **457** bytes. That gives us a secret key file size of **50 Bytes** (including the `CS2107{}` prefix). The file can be broken down into:

```text
 bytes
+-----+
|     |
|     |
| 265 | Head of code
|     |
|     |
+-----+
| 50  | Secret code 
+-----+ 
|     | 
| 142 | Tail of code
|     | 
+-----+

```

We know the contents of the Head and Tail, but not the secret. Looking at the file contents with `hexdump -Cv` (Canonical, no squeezing), each line of 16 bytes corresponds to a character, and it is obvious there are repeats:

```text
...
00000010  aa a8 df 79 8b 71 fa cb  fd 23 4d 81 28 fb 7d f9  |...y.q...#M.(.}.|
...
00000140  aa a8 df 79 8b 71 fa cb  fd 23 4d 81 28 fb 7d f9  |...y.q...#M.(.}.|
...
000001d0  aa a8 df 79 8b 71 fa cb  fd 23 4d 81 28 fb 7d f9  |...y.q...#M.(.}.|
...
```

This is the vulnerability of ECB encryption, since it becomes deterministic when the same plaintext and key are inputted. Now is a game of substitution cipher to figure out the following 50 lines from offset 0x109:

I create a script that reads from the padded `herring.py` and encrypted `output`. Excluding the missing 50 and 800 bytes respectively, The script takes in 16 bytes as key to a dictionary, and a byte of plaintext as key. A simple substitution cipher will be performed:

```py 
OFFSET=265
LENGTH=50

dictionary = {}
cipher_msg=[]
ptr = 0
with open("./output", "rb") as f:
    with open("./padded/herring.py", "r") as g:
        while 1:
            # check if there's anymore char in the padded herring file
            if not g:
                break
            ptr += 1
            if len(cipher_msg) == 50:
                break
            cipher = bytes(f.read(16))
            plaintext = g.read(1)
            # print(plaintext, cipher)
            if ptr > OFFSET and ptr <= OFFSET + LENGTH:
                cipher_msg.append(cipher)
            else:
                dictionary[cipher] = str(plaintext)
decoded=""
for c in cipher_msg:
    decoded += str(dictionary[c])

print(decoded)
```

I break after the 50 bytes since we should (hopefully) have gotten enough pairs to substite. I run the script and:

```text
S2107{byt3_by_byt3_3ncrypt10n_15_k1ll1ng_my_AES!!}
```

Two problems:
1. Classic off-by-one error. But nothing unfixable
2. The `E`, `I` and `O` has comed out as `3`, `1`, and `0`.

But before I try debugging, we cannot ignore that (2) is intended! Sure enough, behond!

Key: `CS2107{byt3_by_byt3_3ncrypt10n_15_k1ll1ng_my_AES!!}`

Attachments:
- `output`

First task is to analyse the files:

```text
╰─❯ file key 
key: OpenSSH public key
╰─❯ file output 
output: FORTRAN program, ASCII text, with very long lines (620), with no 
    line terminators
```

`encrypt.py` contains the following:

```py 
from Crypto.Util.number import getPrime, bytes_to_long, isPrime
from Crypto.PublicKey import RSA

flag = "REDACTED"

def getNextPrime(num):
    is_prime = False
    while not is_prime:
        num += 1
        is_prime = isPrime(num)
    return num


p = getPrime(1024)
q = getNextPrime(p)
n = p * q
e = 65537

key = RSA.construct((n, e)).export_key().decode()

with open("key", "w") as f:
    f.write(key)

m = bytes_to_long(flag.encode())
c = pow(m, e, n)

with open("output", "w") as f:
    f.write(f"c = {c}")
```

The interesting part is how the primes are generated - the first prime using the `getPrime` function, and the next prime simply being the next consequtive prime. According to [this](https://pythonhosted.org/pycrypto/Crypto.Util.number-module.html#getPrime), `getPrime(1024)` will return a random 1024-bit prime number with `Random.new().read`

The contents of `output` actually begins with `c = ` followed by 616 numbers. This the ciphertext. Using the [**PyCryptoDome** documents](https://pycryptodome.readthedocs.io/en/latest/src/public_key/rsa.html#Crypto.PublicKey.RSA.construct) we can tell that an _RsaKey_ is generated, and the inputted tuple `(n, e)` is used accordingly as such:

![RSA eqn](@assets/cs2107-assignment-01/M.2/20250215-043610-original.png)

The `export_key` function exports the keys in bytes, which is converted into string with the `decode` function. The default style is *RFC1421/RFC1423*, or **PEM** encoding - basically **Base64** ASCII with plain-text headers and footers.

This is what `key` has, a public key:

```text
-----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----
MIIBITANBgkqhkiG9w0BAQEFAAOCAQ4AMIIBCQKCAQB2/2ekkxThzDUhcu1qPP4m
jv0KdlVCHMXsP8jufsj+rtp945wQYWHbEt5FVyx2tZz6CPPGKYgmNWuYfXqAgUmi

kUv2l6XKAG0Dd/OT/eFUQHSIF2kYlRYXmrQlseCTJDzTkBt/9pt7SHIgsVcRrIb5
AgMBAAE=
-----END PUBLIC KEY-----
```

We can remove the header and footers, uncipher the base64, and reinteprete the output as an integer to get the public key, or use our good friend [CyberChef](https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/) and do a *PEM to HEX* and *from HEX* conversion to get a file with the keys as raw bytes:

![raw bytes](@assets/cs2107-assignment-01/M.2/20250215-050034-original.png)

But actually, I realised something while reading the documents on the RSA module: I can simply import the public key:

```python
from Crypto.PublicKey import RSA
RSA.import_key(k)
```

Output: 
```text
RsaKey(n=150220..., e=65537)
```

That is the `n` and `e`. `d` is any number such that:

```
1 == (65537 * d) % tot(n)

where tot(p*q) = lcm(p-1, q-1) 
--> Carmichael's totient function
```

### sleep is goood

I went to sleep, and I woke up with a realisation. The [Wikipedia article or RSA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_(cryptosystem)) states that:

> To make factoring harder, p and q should be chosen at random, be both large and **have a large difference**.

This setup does not use a large difference, but literally the next prime. This is bad because then the prime nubmers are basically **very close to the square root of the product**. 

```
let q = p + x + y 

n
= t^2 
= (p)(p+x+y) 
= p^2 + px + py 
= (t-x)(t+y)
= t^2 - xt + yt - xy

yt - xt - xy = 0
yt - xt = xy 
t(y-x) = xy 
t = xy/(y-x)
```

Anyways I don't think this is gonna be fun trying out. I will just brute force. I can round down the square root of `n` to get `t-a`, then find the next prime such that `(t-a)+c = q`. Then I will check if `(n%q)==0`, else continue to the next prime. Eventually `(n%q)==0` is true and `p=n/q` or `p=n/(t-a)+c`.

```py 
from Crypto.PublicKey import RSA
from Crypto.Util.number import isPrime
from math import isqrt, lcm


def getNextPrime(num):
    is_prime = False
    while not is_prime:
        num += 1
        is_prime = isPrime(num)
    return num

with open("key") as f:
    k = f.read()

pub_key = RSA.import_key(k)
n = pub_key.n
e = pub_key.e

p = isqrt(n)
q = 0

while p < n:
    p = getNextPrime(p)
    if n % p == 0:
        q = n // p
        break
assert q > 0
assert p*q==n

# 1 = e*d mod tot(n)
d = pow(e, -1, lcm(p-1, q-1))

private_key = RSA.construct((n, e, d))
c = 5 # Long cipher
dsmg = private_key.decrypt(c)
print(dmsg)
```

Haiz. I took a look at the documentation again:

![PyCryptoDome decrypt](@assets/cs2107-assignment-01/M.2/20250215-184041-original.png)

I need to convert the ciphertext into bytes

```py 
dmsg = PKCS1_OAEP.new(private_key).decrypt(bytes(c))
#                                          ^^^^^^^^
```

I try again

```text

    dmsg = PKCS1_OAEP.new(private_key).decrypt(bytes(c))

OverflowError: cannot fit 'int' into an index-sized integer
```

I look at how this file was created:

```py 
m = bytes_to_long(flag.encode())
c = pow(m, e, n)

with open("output", "w") as f:
    f.write(f"c = {c}")
```

I try doing this instead:

```py 
dmsg = pow(c, e, d)
```

And I try again:

```text 
╰─❯ bpython script.py
12043454892708555159153881......
```

Ok that is good. I just need to convert this into a string of text. I found a function in `Crypto.Util.number` called `long2str`, and also an appropriate `long_to_bytes` which I could have used to convert `c` into bytes but oh well.

```py 
print(long2str(dmsg))
```

I try again

```text

_oh._

```py 
dmsg = PKCS1_OAEP.new(private_key).decrypt(long_to_bytes(c))
```

and....

```text
╰─❯ bpython script.py

    raise ValueError("Incorrect decryption.")
ValueError: Incorrect decryption.
```

When in doubt, blame the library.

Let's go back to manual calculation:

```py 
dmsg = pow(c, e, d)
```

Wait. It is supposed to be `c^d mod n`!

```py 
m = pow(c, d, n)
print(long_to_bytes(m))
```

When manually accessing the service (via *pe111.comp.nus.edu.sg*), I was able to enter text but the reply was [*Mojibake*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mojibake), often with arabic text. Entering more than 40 characters yields an empty string.

I will use the gift of [pwntools](https://docs.pwntools.com/en/dev/intro.html) to help me.

I first make sure that I am able to interface with the server:

```py 
from pwn import ssh
import os
from dotenv import load_dotenv
load_dotenv("../.env")

server="cs2107-ctfd-i.comp.nus.edu.sg"
port=12345

shell = ssh(user=os.getenv("USERNAME"), password=os.getenv("PASSWORD"), 
            host=os.getenv("JUMP_SERVER"))
conn = shell.connect_remote(host=server, port=port)
# start

print(conn.recvlines(timeout=5))

# cleanup
conn.close()
shell.close()
```

Result - I get the `Welcome to the Encryption Service` message!

I create a simple loop to test and try different inputs, and capture the outputs given by the server 

```py 
responses = []
tests = [b"test", b"0"*39, b"1"*40,b"2"*41]
prompt = b"Enter the message you would like to encrypt:"
reply = b"Encrypted Message: "

for test_lines in tests:
    conn.recvuntil(prompt)
    conn.sendline(test_lines)
    conn.recvuntil(reply)
    responses.append(conn.recvline())

for i,line in enumerate(tests):
    print(f"\n\n given:{line}, \n received:{responses[i]}")
```

And as expected, 40 characters is the limit:

```

Now that that is working, I am particularly interested in:

```py 
def encrypt(message):
	if len(message) <= 0 or len(message) > 40: 
		return ''
	result = []
	prev = 0
	for i in range(len(message)):
		c = (ord(message[i]) + prev - ord(FLAG[i % len(FLAG)])) 
		c *= ord(SECRET_KEY[i % len(SECRET_KEY)]) 
		c %= 1114111 # limit range of characters to chr()
		result.append(c)
		prev = c
	print(result)
	return ''.join(map(chr, result))
```

I noticed that:
1. message length is 1-40 characters
2. each character's byte value is added to the previous cipher char, and subtracted from the byte value of the character of the flag at the index of the current message charater index 
3. this is then multiplied by the byte value of the ith character of secret key 

For the very first character, `prev` is zero. So if `m0` is the byte of the first character given, and `m1` is the next byte, the encrypted ciphertext byte is:

```py
f0 = ord(FLAG[0])
s0 = ord(SECRET_KEY[0])
c0 = (m0 - f0) * s0 

f1 = ord(FLAG[1])
s1 = ord(SECRET_KEY[1])
c1 = (m1 + c0 - f1) * s1 
```

if we can find an `m0` such that `c0` is zero, then 

```py
#     (m0 - f0) * s0 == 0
# ==> (f0 - f0) * s0 == 0
# ==> m0 == f0

c0 = 0
c1 = (m1 - f1) * s1 
```

Note how the `m0` is equal to `f0` because `f` and `s` are assumed to be nonzero.

```py
guesses = b""
for i in range(40):
    for x in range(255):
        guess = guesses + x.to_bytes()
        conn.recvuntil(prompt)
        conn.sendline(guess)
        conn.recvuntil(reply)
        y = conn.recvline().strip()
        print(f"[{x}] guess: {guess}, response: {y.decode()}")
        if y == 0:
            guesses += bytes(x)
            break
print(guesses)
```

What I get:
![stuck response](@assets/cs2107-assignment-01/M.3/20250215-225702-original.png)

The console freezes after 127th character.

This is when I realised my mistake. The `bytes()` function is overloaded and can either take in an array or an integer with different outcomes:

![bytes](@assets/cs2107-assignment-01/M.3/20250215-230136-original.png)

I fixed the loop:

```py 
guesses = b""
for i in range(40):
    for x in range(256):
        guess = guesses + (bytes([x]))

        conn.recvuntil(prompt)
        conn.sendline(guess)
        conn.recvuntil(reply)

        y = int.from_bytes(conn.recvline().strip())
        if y == 0:
            print(f"[{i}][{x}] guess: {guess}, response: {y}")
            guesses = guesses + (bytes([x]))
            break
print(guesses)
```

And reran the script.

```text 
[0][9] guess: b'\t', response: 0
[1][9] guess: b'\t\t', response: 0
[2][9] guess: b'\t\t\t', response: 0
[3][9] guess: b'\t\t\t\t', response: 0
[4][9] guess: b'\t\t\t\t\t', response: 0
[5][9] guess: b'\t\t\t\t\t\t', response: 0
```

Now, something is wrong because this is definitely not right. I assume it is because of this line in the server:

```py
message = client_socket.recv(128).decode('utf-8').strip()
```

The `strip` takes out the whitespace character (ie `\t`) and a blank message will return a blank cipher, so that's not right. This also means my check for null characters is not technically right since a string of byte objects of `\x00` is not the integer `0`. Changes:

```py
# strip will not remove null bytes but will remove whitespaces:
# >>> bytes([0]).decode().strip()
# '\x00'
# >>> bytes([ord('\t')]).decode().strip()
# ''
test_byte = (bytes([x]))
if len(test_byte.decode().strip()) == 0:
    continue
guess = guesses + test_byte

# .....
# change the check to test all bytes and use all() to fold results
y = conn.recvline().strip()
if all(b == 0 for b in y):
```

And this was glorious, watching the characters come out one by one:

It's just 8 random bytes that you have to guess. Time to test your luck!

Is there any issue with reusing the same PRNG an unlimited number of times? 
    I heard there's a Python package that can help you with this...something 
    about "rand" and "crack"...

How does Python implement random.randbytes? How does it relate to 
    random.getrandbits? Look at the Python source code!
```

Attachments:
- `server.py`


First, let's see the `server.py` contents:

```py 
import random

FLAG = "REDACTED"

print("Hey, see if you can get the next hexadecimal value!")

while True:
    # Original challenge was simply random.randbytes(4)
    # which meant you just needed to iterate through 624 times
    # instead of 312 times but splitting the hex into 2 to submit
    correct = random.randbytes(8).hex()
    guess = input("Your guess: ")
    if guess == correct:
        print(f"Wow, you must be so lucky! Here's your flag: {FLAG}")
        break
    else:
        print(f"Unlucky, the correct number was {correct}. Try again!")
```

Looks like a task to exploit the pseudorandom generator's **pseudo** randomness.

I first whip up a `scripy.py`:

```py 
from pwn import ssh
import os
from dotenv import load_dotenv
load_dotenv("../.env")

server="cs2107-ctfd-i.comp.nus.edu.sg"
port=8001

shell = ssh(user=os.getenv("USERNAME"), password=os.getenv("PASSWORD"), 
            host=os.getenv("JUMP_SERVER"))
conn = shell.connect_remote(host=server, port=port)
# start

prompt = b"Your guess: "
correct = b"Wow, you must be so lucky! Here's your flag: "
wrong = b"Unlucky, the correct number was "
conn.recvuntil(prompt)
conn.sendline(bytes([0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]).hex())
result = conn.recvline()
print(result)

# cleanup
conn.close()
shell.close()
```

```text 
b'Unlucky, the correct number was 794e47ec8e94cac5. Try again!\n'
```

Ok it works. Now the trick is to continuously try until the response matches the correct string. It is not feasible to loop over `2^8^8` guesses, so let's look at *randbytes*. The documents say:

> random.randbytes(n)
>   Generate n random bytes.
>   This method should not be used for generating security tokens. Use secrets.token_bytes() instead.

In the source code `random.py`, this is how we get the random bytes:

```py 
def randbytes(self, n):
    """Generate n random bytes."""
    return self.getrandbits(n * 8).to_bytes(n, 'little')

def getrandbits(self, k):
    """getrandbits(k) -> x.  Generates an int with k random bits."""
    if k < 0:
        raise ValueError('number of bits must be non-negative')
    numbytes = (k + 7) // 8                       # bits / 8 and rounded up
    x = int.from_bytes(_urandom(numbytes))
    return x >> (numbytes * 8 - k)                # trim excess bits
```

So to put in context, this is what happens:

```text
random.randbytes(8)
==> getrandbits(64).to_bytes(8, 'little')
==> int.from_bytes(_urandom(8))                
```

I cannot deny, I was lost here until I saw the hint for using randcrack. Also the title of this challence is *Mersenne Untwister*, which is a nod to the **Mersenne Twister** pseudorandom generator. Providing 624 32-bit numbers (4 bytes) would tweak the matrix enough to produce the same output as the pseudorandom generator used by `urandom`

I had to install _randcrack_ from the repo as it is not packaged in the nixpkgs repositoy

```nix 
(
    buildPythonPackage rec {
        pname = "randcrack";
        version = "0.2.0";
        src = fetchPypi {
            inherit pname version;
            sha256 = "sha256-zM9OzeoUdmZTDwgm0Rpyv8lnzNerNuLt+alR3nwHAhs=";
        };
        doCheck = false;
    }
)
```

I set up _randcrack_:

```py 
from randcrack import RandCrack
rc = RandCrack()

# ...

for i in range(624 // 2):

# ...

rc.submit(int(last_correct[:8], 16))
rc.submit(int(last_correct[8:], 16))

# ...


guess = rc.predict_getrandbits(64).to_bytes(8, 'little')
conn.recvuntil(prompt)
conn.sendline(bytes([0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]).hex())
result = conn.recvline()
if result.decode().startswith(correct):
    print(result)
else:
    last_correct = result[len(wrong):len(wrong)+(8*2)]
    print(f"It was {last_correct} not {guess}")
```

Anyways it did not work. I am sad. I try a few things. One is to just submit the number as a single 64-bit integer and not 2 32-bit integers. 
```py 
# rc.submit(int(last_correct[:8], 16))
# rc.submit(int(last_correct[8:], 16))
rc.submit(int(last_correct, 16))
```

I also try changing the endianness:

```py 
guess = rc.predict_getrandbits(64).to_bytes(8, 'big').hex()
```

Unfortunately I got:

```text
ValueError: Didn't recieve enough bits to predict
```

So I have to manually split and feed the 32 bit numbers. I think maybe there might be an endianness issue.

I had to go toilet, and while on the thinking throne I did some test:

![online intepreter code](@assets/cs2107-assignment-01/H.1/photo_2025-02-16_02-28-11.jpg)
![online intepreter result](@assets/cs2107-assignment-01/H.1/photo_2025-02-16_02-27-50.jpg)

So this should be the correct order since the first 4 bytes comes first, in order, followed by the next 4 bytes

```py 
# received bytes are of: 
# --> random.randbytes(8).hex()
# --> random.getrandbits(64).to_bytes(8, 'little').hex()
rc.submit(int(last_correct[:8], 16))
rc.submit(int(last_correct[8:], 16))
```

Still not working. I decided to do a sanity check to see if I am using _randcrack_ correctly:

```py 
import random
from randcrack import RandCrack 


random.seed(0)
rc = RandCrack()

for i in range(624):
    # n = random.randbytes(4).hex()
    n = random.getrandbits(32)
    rc.submit(n)

print(f"Random result: {random.getrandbits(32)}\nCracker result: 
    {rc.predict_getrandbits(32)}")

"""
╰─❯ bpython test.py
Random result: 2229104038
Cracker result: 2229104038
"""

random.seed(0)
rc = RandCrack()

for i in range(624):
    n = random.randbytes(4).hex()
    rc.submit(int(n, 16))

print(f"Random result: {random.getrandbits(32)}\nCracker result: 
    {rc.predict_getrandbits(32)}")

"""
╰─❯ bpython test.py
Random result: 2229104038
Cracker result: 2437392779
"""
```

Ah, there seems to be an issue with converting the hex strings back into string. I am guessing it has to do with either endianness or signs. After some tinkering, I got it:

```py 
for i in range(624):
    n = random.randbytes(4)
    bs = [b for b in n]
    bs.reverse()
    rc.submit(int(bytes(bs).hex(),16))

print(f"Random result: {random.getrandbits(32)}\nCracker result: 
    {rc.predict_getrandbits(32)}")

"""
╰─❯ bpython test.py
Random result: 2229104038
Cracker result: 2229104038
"""
```

It was the endianness!
I now need to reverse the inputs I get from the server, and then feed it into _randcrack_ but byte by byte...

```py 
random.seed(0)
rc = RandCrack()

for i in range(624):
    n = random.randbytes(4).hex()
    bytes_of_number = [n[i:2+i] for i in range(0, 8, 2)]
    bytes_of_number.reverse()
    rc.submit(int(''.join(bytes_of_number), 16))

print(f"Random result: {random.getrandbits(32)}\nCracker result: 
    {rc.predict_getrandbits(32)}")

"""
╰─❯ bpython test.py
Random result: 2229104038
Cracker result: 2229104038
"""

random.seed(0)
rc = RandCrack()

for i in range(312):
    n = random.randbytes(8).hex()
    bytes_of_number = [n[i:2+i] for i in range(0, 16, 2)]
    bytes_of_number.reverse()
    rc.submit(int(''.join(bytes_of_number[4:]), 16))
    rc.submit(int(''.join(bytes_of_number[:4]), 16))

print(f"Random result: {random.getrandbits(32)}\nCracker result: 
    {rc.predict_getrandbits(32)}")

"""
╰─❯ bpython test.py
Random result: 2229104038
Cracker result: 2229104038
"""
```

Perfect! I now need to bring this carefully into the actual script...

```py 
n = result[len(wrong):len(wrong)+(8*2)].decode()
bytes_of_number = [n[i:2+i] for i in range(0, 16, 2)]
bytes_of_number.reverse()
rc.submit(int(''.join(bytes_of_number[4:]), 16))
rc.submit(int(''.join(bytes_of_number[:4]), 16))
```

Quick things I notice:
1. flag is 32 charaters long
2. We are being told the server time, but it is first converted to localtime and then formatted
3. this time function is being used to set the seed for AES key generation

I quickly copy the script I had for the other challenges and made a quick basic script:

```py 
from pwn import ssh
import os
from dotenv import load_dotenv
load_dotenv("../.env")

server="cs2107-ctfd-i.comp.nus.edu.sg"
port=13337

shell = ssh(user=os.getenv("USERNAME"), password=os.getenv("PASSWORD"), 
            host=os.getenv("JUMP_SERVER"))
conn = shell.connect_remote(host=server, port=port)
# start
cipher_prompt = b"Here's the encrypted flag in hexadecimal: "
prompt = b"You can tell me your guess, and I'll let you know if it's correct:\n"

print(conn.recvuntil(cipher_prompt).decode())
cipher = conn.recvline()

conn.recvuntil(prompt)
conn.sendline(bytes(32)) # empty response

response = conn.recvline()
print(response.decode())
# cleanup
conn.close()
shell.close()
```

This is the response:

```

for context, my local machine time is: `Sat Feb 16 04:00:20 2025`. 

**do not judge my working hours**.

If I can get the key generated by `rand()`, which might be possible by grabbing the seed used (in this case the `time`) then I can generate the key by myself dynamically.

I just decided to build this server on my local machine, and:

```text

Mon Feb 17 16:13:59 2025

*** buffer overflow detected ***: terminated
fish: Job 2, './chall' terminated by signal SIGABRT (Abort)
```

Oops. ok I will just try step by step. Anyways there are a few things to learn about time in `C`. 

1. the `time()` function returns a `time_t` type which is a unix timestamp integer.
2. the`gmtime()` and `localtime()` functions convert `time_t` to `struct tm` which containts the timestamp broken into human readable components, converted to UTC or local time respectively.
3. To reverse this, `mktime()` converts `struct tm` back to `time_t`.
4. the `asctime()` function converts `struct tm` into a readable `string` of the format `Www Mmm dd hh:mm:ss yyyy`.

This should show the `time_t` and `string` formats:

```c 
int main() {
    time_t raw;
    time(&raw);
    printf("string local: %s\n", asctime(localtime(&raw)));
    printf("string UTC: %s\n", asctime(gmtime(&raw)));
    printf("raw time_t: %ld\n", raw);
    return 0;
}
```

Output:

```text 
╰─❯ gcc test.c -o test
╰─❯ chmod +x test
╰─❯ ./test
string local: Mon Feb 17 16:45:37 2025

string UTC: Mon Feb 17 08:45:37 2025

raw time_t: 1739781937
```

This is how the string is formatted from `tm`:

```text
  str:  Mon Feb 17 08:45:37 2025
  int:   1  2   17 08 45 37  123
         |  |   |  |  |  |   |
tm_sec --|--|---|--|--|--+   |
tm_min --|--|---|--|--+      |
tm_hour--|--|---|--+         |
tm_mday--|--|---+            |
tm_mon --|--+                |
tm_year--|-------------------+
tm_wday--+
tm_yday
tm_isdst
```

If we run this python script, we can get the correct epoch time:

```py 
date_time = datetime.datetime(2025, 2, 17, 8, 45, 37)
print("unix_timestamp => ", (time.mktime(date_time.timetuple())))

"""
output:
unix_timestamp =>  1739781937.0
"""
```

From the test done earlier when connecting to the server, the server's local time seems to be UTC time, so we can directly convert the string to unix timestamp. I decided to use python's `datetime.strptime` to get the timestamp:

```py 
conn.recvuntil(time_prompt)
time_str = conn.recvline().decode().strip()
utc_time = datetime.strptime(time_str, "%a %b %d %H:%M:%S %Y")
timestamp = datetime.timestamp(utc_time)
```

This can then be fed back into the test c file which initialises the aes implementation and seeds the `srand` with the retrieved timestamp:

```c 
// seed rnd
long timestamp = strtol(argv[1], NULL, 10);
srand(timestamp);

// Generate AES-128 key
unsigned char buf[16];
int i;
for (i = 0; i < sizeof(buf); i++) {
    buf[i] = rand() % 256;
}

struct AES_ctx* ctx = malloc(sizeof(struct AES_ctx));
AES_init_ctx(ctx, buf);

// convert hex string to char array
unsigned char flag_encrypted[32];
unsigned char *dst = flag_encrypted;
unsigned char *end = flag_encrypted + sizeof(flag_encrypted);
char *src = argv[2];
unsigned int u;
while (dst < end && sscanf(src, "%2x", &u) == 1)
{
    *dst++ = u;
    src += 2;
}

AES_ECB_decrypt(ctx, flag_encrypted);
printf("%s", flag_encrypted);
```

My only concern is that the time outputted by the server and the seed used by the server differs by a few milliseconds, but it should not be an issue since unix integer timestamps have **one second resolution** so as long as the consecutive operations occur within the same second, the value returned by `time()` should be the same.

```text 
JzZ,snd0m_4ft3r_4ll?}
```

This is what I get as the output. Strange. If I let my python script collect the result via `subprocess.check_output`, I get this string of bytes:

```text
b'2\xf0]\x98~\xef\xc6\x0f\xdf?w\x85\x85\x9a\xb4\x11nd0m_4ft3r_4ll?}\n'
```

The good thing is that it is consistant. This suggests that the time that I grab and the actual time used is off. This could be due to the server actually not running on the correctly synchronised time - so its local time is not GMT+00 but some other time zone, offsetting the actual wrong system time.

What time zone? I do not know. I think at this point, I am gonna try brute force different offsets:

```py 
conn.recvuntil(time_prompt)
time_str = conn.recvline().decode().strip()
utc_time = datetime.strptime(time_str, "%a %b %d %H:%M:%S %Y") 
    + timedelta(hours=offset)
timestamp = int(datetime.timestamp(utc_time))
```

results:

wonderful. I should have guessed it was 8h difference. But we can't always be sure. 

Key: `CS2107{n0t_s0_r4nd0m_4ft3r_4ll?}`
