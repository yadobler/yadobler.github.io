Huntress CTF 2024 was an exhilarating experience, held throughout October in celebration of Cybersecurity Awareness Month. With fresh challenges released daily, it offered a dynamic and engaging way to explore the field of cybersecurity. As my first-ever CTF, it was a manageable yet rewarding dive into topics like reverse engineering and problem-solving. Although designed as a team challenge, I tackled it solo, which made the learning experience even more personal and gratifying.

One standout for me was the [OSINT challenge](ran_somewhere), which cleverly incorporated real-world elements into the puzzle. It was a refreshing change of pace and a reminder of the practical applications of cybersecurity skills beyond the digital realm. The challenge pushed me to think creatively and connect seemingly unrelated pieces of informationâ€”skills vital in cybersecurity investigations.

Unfortunately, I fell ill during the final week, leaving some challenges unfinished, but the journey up until then was nothing short of transformative. The camaraderie with fellow contestants and Huntress staff added a vibrant social element to the event. That said, I quickly understood why many participants chose to disable direct messages; it was a bit disheartening to see people skip ahead and seek answers without attempting to progress naturally.

Despite these setbacks, Huntress CTF 2024 was a fantastic introduction to the world of CTFs and an inspiring reminder of the creativity and collaboration at the heart of cybersecurity. Special thanks to ChatGPT for brainstorming and importantly for generating scripts quickly when given the appropriate goals, which helped reduce time wasted trying to debug scripts. Definitely a help especially since I also had school work to complete.
