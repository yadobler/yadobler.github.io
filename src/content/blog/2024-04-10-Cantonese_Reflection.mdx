*This article uses [Jyut-ping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jyutping) to transcribe Cantonese!*

<Furigana hanzi="你好嗎" jyutping="nei5 hou2 maa1" />? <Furigana hanzi="最近點啊" jyutping="zeoi3 gan6 dim2 aa3" />? <Furigana hanzi="我名叫威玉鉤" jyutping="ngo5 ming2 giu3 wai1 juk6 ngau1" /> (Yuknavell). This is my End-of-Semester reflection for DMA1401L01 Spoken Cantonese. Initially I was <Furigana hanzi="緊張" jyutping="gan2 zoeng1" /> (nervous) as I was one of the only non-Chinese while many were of Cantonese roots wanting to pick up their mother tongue. I only have a modest background in mandarin to back me up. 

Thankfully the lessons were digestible. I did sit in front, and was able to practice on the spot with classmates beside me. We started from the basics, and <Furigana hanzi="老師" jyutping="lou5 si1" /> (Teacher) brought us through the pronunciations and when to use the phrases. We were all made to practice out loud in front of the class. I was unprepared but it was good to practice out loud. Even got a round of applause from the others 😅. Each class finished off with <Furigana hanzi="老師" jyutping="lou5 si1" /> singing, while explaining the poetic and strategic use of Cantonese in the lyrics. 

We focused on speaking, and the various mannerisms and phrases that are useful - something refreshing from traditional written language classes that goes bottom up from teaching every rule. <Furigana hanzi="老師" jyutping="lou5 si1" />'s top-down approach meant we got familiar with the speech and get a feel of Cantonese communication so that we can use it well.

Unexpectedly, Cantonese is not merely a different way of pronouncing Chinese Characters*, but have completely different words for many things (**<Furigana hanzi="佢" jyutping="keoi5" />** instead of **<Furigana hanzi="他" jyutping="taa1" />** for 3rd-person; **<Furigana hanzi="嘅" jyutping="ge3" />** instead of **<Furigana hanzi="的" jyutping="dik1" />** for possession marking; **<Furigana hanzi="唔" jyutping="m4" />** instead of **<Furigana hanzi="不" jyutping="bat1" />** for negation; etc...), as well as a dissimilar grammar structure (using **<Furigana hanzi="咗" jyutping="zo2" />** directly after verbs to mark "completion" instead of **<Furigana hanzi="了" jyutping="liu5" />** at the end of sentence like in mandarin; extensive use of sentence-final particles to disambiguate the sentence's semantic meanings; etc...). In fact, the **<Furigana hanzi="阿" jyutping="aa3" />** and **<Furigana hanzi="喇" jyutping="laa3" />** at the end of sentences are important for denoting politeness - without it the sentence becomes rude, and if raised from mid-tone to high-tone (**<Furigana hanzi="吖" jyutping="aa1" />**, **<Furigana hanzi="喇" jyutping="laa1" />**) it can be either rude, pointing out something obvious, or even when enumerating a list (fruits like apple **<Furigana hanzi="喇" jyutping="laa1" />**, orange **<Furigana hanzi="喇" jyutping="laa1" />**, banana **<Furigana hanzi="喇" jyutping="laa1" />**).

We learnt some interesting phrases, like **<Furigana hanzi="混吉" jyutping="wan6 gat1" />** referring to someone who waste time without committing or doing anything meaningful - this came from customers who came into shops and just fiddled with (**<Furigana hanzi="混" jyutping="wan6" />**) the water offered by shop owners as a sign of hospitality. The water were called **<Furigana hanzi="吉水" jyutping="gat1 seoi2" />** because plain water (**<Furigana hanzi="空水" jyutping="hung1 seoi2" />**) sounded like Evil water (**<Furigana hanzi="兇水" jyutping="hung1 seoi2" />**) so empty (**<Furigana hanzi="空" jyutping="hung1" />**) is euphemistically renamed as **<Furigana hanzi="吉" jyutping="gat1" />**, meaning auspicious. People who came into shops and just swirled the given **<Furigana hanzi="吉水" jyutping="gat1 seoi2" />** without buying anything were called **<Furigana hanzi="混吉" jyutping="wan6 gat1" />** - somebody who wastes one's time without anything meaningful arising from it.

Lastly, the assignments given are definitely unique. We had to do a remix of any Cantonese song, which amazingly is a common occurrence in real life! (A great real-life example, (*ignoring the <Furigana hanzi="鹹濕" jyutping="haam4 sap1" /> songs*) is Anita Mui's **<Furigana hanzi="夕陽之歌" jyutping="zik6 joeng4 zi1 go1" />** vs Priscilla Chan's **<Furigana hanzi="千千闕歌" jyutping="cin1 cin1 kyut3 go1" />**, both from the same Japanese song). My rendition of **<Furigana hanzi="光輝歲月" jyutping="gwong1 fai1 seoi3 jyut6" />** was rewritten as a tribute to my mother and the trials and tribulations she faced, akin to how Beyond wrote the famous song as a tribute to the struggles of Nelson Mandela. We also had to do an interview, which I did with my classmate Moses, and it was very fun trying to work things out and sound legitimate.

To finish off, I really got a new perspective on Cantonese, the Hong Kong folks, as well as got to know how pervasive Cantonese actually is within Singapore! I also started watching Cantonese Dramas, starting with **Triumph in the Skies** - and it feels surreal seeing the phrases I learnt in class! I hope that I continue on my journey in learning and exploring Cantonese, which began from this class.

**<Furigana hanzi="唔該" jyutping="m4 goi1" />, <Furigana hanzi="下次見" jyutping="ha6 ci3 gin3" />!**
