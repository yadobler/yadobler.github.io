"**esoteric**". Very strange. The file was also hilarious. Here's the first line:
```
OOO MoO MoO MoO MoO MoO MoO MoO MoO MMM moO MMM MMM moO MMM MOO MOo mOo MoO moO moo mOo
```

I knew it was an esoteric language, and needed to find the correct interpreter. Quick google search taught me it was **Cow** language, and i used [this online interpreter](https://frank-buss.de/cow.html) to evaluate and get the flag.
