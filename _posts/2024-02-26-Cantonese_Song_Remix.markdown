Nei5 Hou2!

Firstly, [here is my remix](https://youtu.be/m2CqFGLIeMs?si=4avCqoyLSvyLV4mA).

For the assignment, we are supposed to remix a cantonese song with what we like. There are soo many classics to choose from, and I decided on this:

**光輝歲月 (gwong1 fai1 seoi3 jyut6)** by _Beyond_

"Glorious days" (literally: Shining glorious years and months) is a popular song in Hong Kong, over the decades, for its tune, message, and declaration of sovereign identity for Hongkongers. The song reflects on freedom fighter Nelson Mendela, and his struggle as a human descriminated by his skin. Struggling for years, one hopes to one day welcome the glorious years where racism is no longer the norm. 

For my remix, I decided to dedicate this to my mother, who I can argue has been the freedom fighter for the glorious years that her kids will welcome. She faced her fair share of descrimination growing up in an Asian society that once was not as kind to darker skin, as well as valued and dichotomously evaluated one's worth based on the results of rote education. A woman of many talents, she leveraged the support systems of the maturing Singaporean landscape to provide us kids with safe shelter and excellent education. While she garnered the envy of many around her, only she knew the lonely journey growing up, repeatly tripping, and slowly learning the ropes of life. 

The song process first started with breaking the original song into its different stanza. I noted the tones of each syllable to follow the pitch changes. It almost exposes itself to be a pentatonic scale, with tones 1,3,6 being the first, third and fifth note from high to low. Tones 2, 4 and 5 glide between them, often touching the second and forth notes. Checked tones (ending with -k/-p/-t) are also important for the prosody. 

Next up was finding meaningful phrases. I decided to keep the main line in the chorus (迎接光輝歲月 jing4 zip3 gwong1 fai1 seoi3 jyut6), since its meaning (welcome the glorious years) was perfect for my remix. The rest was sweeping through various idioms found in Pleco and Wiktionary. This [jyut dict](https://github.com/aaronhktan/jyut-dict/) was also great, being able to use wildcards to find phrases that rhyme. 

After that, the scary part comes - singing it. I'm no singer, except maybe at karaoke. I have to admit, I waited for a day when I had a free schedule at home while no one else did. This [hambaanglaang site](http://test.hambaanglaang.hk/) was amazing for generating "musical bars" for each syllable, while [this hongkongvision site](https://hongkongvision.com/tool/cc_py_conv_en) gave the Jyutping needed to sing them. I also used [narakeet](https://www.narakeet.com/app/text-to-audio) to generate a cantonese text-to-speech so that I can listen to how it should or might sound. I also ran through ChatGPT, who was able to scan through the lyrics and summarise the meaning, giving me extra assurance that the remix made sense. ChatGPT was also very reassuring to me, almost _fatherly_ vibes. 

After some dry runs, I recorded my voice, over this [backing track from YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yg4rXIKkAt8). I then _extracted_ the lyrics file from the video, and swapped it with my lyrics to ensure synchronised timing. 

**Finally, I could upload it!**

I was so shy about it, I got my friend to share it to my mom. 🤭 (m'goi saai Shaun!) 

She loved it. She was proud that I could understand her. She played it on repeat, even though I cringed at the sound of my voice. But she was happy, and that makes me happy.

Here's the lyrics:

Ask: "isn't it tough to continue like this?" She says, 
問繼續噉唔難咩佢講,
man6 gai3 zuk6 gam2 m4 naan4 me1 keoi5 gong2, 

"Nothings tough under the skies
天下無難事,
tin1 haa6 mou4 naan4 si6, 

for those who set their mind" 
只怕有心人;
zi2 paa3 jau5 sam1 jan4;

    
    
Childhood to adulthood, folks never supported
從小到大人哋未支持;
cung4 siu2 dou3 daai6 jan4 dei6 mei6 zi1 ci4;

So no matter what she'll support. 
所以無論點佢會支援;
so2 ji5 mou4 leon6 dim2 keoi5 wui5 zi1 wun4;
    
    

Mother sows saplings to let her kids, 
媽媽栽樹讓仔女可以,
maa4 maa1 zoi1 syu6 joeng6 zai2 neoi2 ho2 ji5,

Welcome the glorious days, 
迎接光辉岁月;
jing4 zip3 gwong1 fai1 seoi3 jyut6;

Fight for a future where one has shade to rest under. 
爭第日後人乘涼;
zaang1 dai6 jat6 hau6 jan4 sing4 loeng4;

How can one catch cubs without entering the tiger den? 
不入虎穴焉得虎子吖?
bat1 jap6 fu2 jyut6 jin4 dak1 fu2 zi2 aa1?

Although the horse died and the remaining journey on foot is long, 
雖然馬死落地行,
seoi1 jin4 maa5 sei2 lok6 dei6 haang4,

She will never give up. 
但佢再接再厲;
daan6 keoi5 zoi3 zip3 zoi3 lai6;
     
    

Many force her to give up yet she refused, 
人哋逼佢放棄佢拒絕,
jan4 dei6 bik1 keoi5 fong3 hei3 keoi5 keoi5 zyut6,

She's self reliant on her two feet,
佢自立自強,
keoi5 zi6 laap6 zi6 koeng4,

Like the resurrecting saltfish. 
類似鹹魚翻生;
leoi6 ci5 haam4 jyu2 faan1 saang1;

When I get anxious of my life, she says, 
當我對命仔緊張佢說,
dong1 ngo5 deoi3 meng6 zai2 gan2 zoeng1 keoi5 syut3,

Heaven helps whose who helps themselves, 
天助自助者, 
tin1 zo6 zi6 zo6 ze2,
 
Human or not, only one life, 
人一世物一世.
jan4 jat1 sai3 mat6 jat1 sai3.
    
    

Childhood to adulthoof, folks never supported
